# 🐍😎 A ~~fully functional~~ Python Chat! 🐍😎
##### Made by moi

## About
#### This is a chatting program, used with filing *(a bad technique, but I only knew this way for console python)*. You can chat, but you have to reload the page every few minutes for the messages to load. 

## Code
#### The code is actually pretty simple, it uses file opening, and file writing, etc. I added colors, just to make it more fun ^_^

## Closing
#### I hope you guys enjoy using this program! IF you haven't already, visit [this](https://repl.it/talk/templates/Python-Chatting-Template/116205) for more info! Thanks!

> **NOTE: Please don't ask for editing access, it annoys me and you can just fork it. Thanks!**
